### **1. Custom Instructions for SPARC**

#### Global SPARC Instructions:
**Settings > Cursor Settings > General > Instructions**

```markdown
# SPARC Methodology Instructions for Cursor

## Core Development Philosophy
You are operating under the SPARC methodology:
- **S**pecification: Always clarify requirements before coding
- **P**seudocode: Break down complex logic into clear steps
- **A**rchitecture: Design modular, scalable components
- **R**efinement: Implement with TDD, security, and optimization
- **C**ompletion: Integration, documentation, and deployment

## Mandatory Standards
- Keep ALL files under 500 lines maximum
- NEVER hard-code environment variables, API keys, or secrets
- Use environment variable references: `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
- Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Write tests for all functionality (minimum 80% coverage)
- Follow security best practices (OWASP guidelines)
- Create modular, reusable components
- Document all functions with JSDoc comments

## Code Quality Requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Implement graceful error handling
- Use async/await over promises
- Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs

## File Structure Standards
```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── services/       # Business logic services
├── utils/          # Helper functions
├── types/          # TypeScript definitions
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks (if applicable)
├── config/         # Configuration management
└── tests/          # Test files
```

## Security Guidelines
- Never expose sensitive data in client-side code
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Implement rate limiting and CORS properly
- Log security events for monitoring

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all pure functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI elements
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## When Breaking Down Work
1. **Specification Phase**: Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Pseudocode Phase**: Outline logic and data flow
3. **Architecture Phase**: Design components and interfaces
4. **Refinement Phase**: Implement with TDD approach
5. **Completion Phase**: Integration, documentation, deployment

Always ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous.
When making changes to existing code, analyze the impact on other components.
Prioritize maintainability and readability over clever optimizations.
```

  ],
  "cursor.indexing.excludePatterns": [
    "node_modules/**/*",
    "dist/**/*",
    ".git/**/*",
    "*.log"
  ]
}
```

#### Smart Context Management:
```markdown
# Effective prompting strategies:

✅ "Implement user authentication following the existing patterns in @src/middleware/auth.js"

✅ "@web latest JWT security best practices, then implement secure token management"

✅ "Add comprehensive error handling to @src/services/UserService.ts following project patterns"

❌ "Make this code better" (too vague)
❌ "Fix everything" (no context)
❌ "Here's my entire 1000-line file, update it" (too large)
```

### **3. Quality Gates**

#### Automated Quality Checks:
```javascript
// Add to package.json scripts:
{
  "scripts": {
    "sparc:validate": "npm run lint && npm run test && npm run security-check && npm run size-check",
    "size-check": "find src -name '*.ts' -o -name '*.js' | xargs wc -l | awk '$1 > 500 {print \"File too large: \" $2 \" (\" $1 \" lines)\"; exit 1}'",
    "security-check": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts,.js",
    "test": "jest --coverage --coverageThreshold='{\"global\":{\"branches\":80,\"functions\":80,\"lines\":80,\"statements\":80}}'"
  }
}
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks:
```bash
# Install husky for git hooks
npm install --save-dev husky

# Add pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run sparc:validate"
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Optimization

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### 1. Cursor Running Slowly
```bash
# Clear cache and restart
Cmd+Shift+P > "Cursor: Restart Extension Host"

# Reduce context size
# Settings > Cursor > Chat > Max Context Length: 8000

# Disable unnecessary indexing
# Settings > Cursor > Indexing > Exclude large directories
```

#### 2. Claude Getting "Tired"
```markdown
# Issue: Claude responses degrading after 30-60 minutes
# Solution: Restart conversation

# In Cursor Chat:
1. Click "New Chat" button
2. Or use Cmd+Shift+L (new conversation)
3. Re-establish context with key files

# Prevention:
- Start new conversations for different features
- Use Composer for complex multi-file tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller chunks
```

#### 3. Composer Not Working Properly
```bash
# Common fixes:
1. Ensure files are properly added to context
2. Check file size limits (under 500 lines each)
3. Restart Cursor if Composer becomes unresponsive
4. Clear chat history and restart conversation

# For .md files issues:
# Use specific instructions:
"Update only the specified section of the markdown file, preserve all other content exactly as is"
```

#### 4. Context Limit Errors
```markdown
# Strategies to manage context:
1. Focus on specific files for each task
2. Use @codebase for general queries
3. Break large tasks into smaller ones
4. Remove unnecessary files from context
5. Use Composer for multi-file tasks, Chat for single-file

# Example of focused context:
"@src/components/UserProfile.tsx @src/types/User.ts 
Add form validation to the user profile component"
```

### **Performance Tips**

#### 1. Efficient Prompting
```markdown
# Good prompts:
"Following SPARC methodology, add email validation to the user registration form in @src/components/SignUp.tsx"

"Implement error handling for the payment service following the pattern in @src/services/AuthService.ts"

"@web research React 18 concurrent features, then optimize @src/components/DataTable.tsx for large datasets"

# Bad prompts:
"Make it work"
"Fix this"
"Optimize everything"
```

#### 2. Context Strategy
```markdown
# For new features:
- Include related existing files
- Add type definitions
- Include relevant tests
- Add configuration files

# For bug fixes:
- Include the problematic file
- Add related test files
- Include error logs
- Add relevant dependencies

# For refactoring:
- Include files to be changed
- Add test files
- Include architecture documentation
- Add related components
```

#### 3. Model Selection
```json
{
  "cursor.chat.model": "claude-3.5-sonnet",     // Best for complex logic
  "cursor.composer.model": "claude-3.5-sonnet", // Best for multi-file
  "cursor.autocomplete.model": "gpt-4o-mini"    // Fast for autocomplete
}
```
